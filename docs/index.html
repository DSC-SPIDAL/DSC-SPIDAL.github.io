<p class="whitetext">The goal for the SPIDAL project is to create software abstractions to help connect communities together with applications in different scientific fields, letting us collaborate and use other communitiesâ€™ tools without having to understand all of their details. The project will integrate features of traditional high-performance computing, such as scientific libraries, communication and resource management middleware, with the rich set of capabilities found in the commercial Big Data ecosystem. The latter includes many important software systems, such as Hadoop, available from the Apache open source community. 
</p>
<p class="whitetext">At present one of our main goals is to establish a set of benchmarks for Big Data analysis in the spirit of the Berkeley Dwarfs and NIST 2013 Big Data Applications. Through the publication of several research papers in the past year, we have sought to collect applications and their feature and summarize key properties, followed by identifying and classifying requirements with comparison to already established attributes like those of NIST. Our work has culminated in the definition of around 50 essential features or 'facets' of Big Data that we call Ogres.</p>
<p class="whitetext">These Ogres are further divided into four distinct views: Problem Architecture View (AV), Execution View (EV); Data Source and Style View (DV), and Processing View (PV). The following table highlights the different views and their corresponding facets.

<p class="whitetext">Dr. Geoffrey Fox delivered a presentation entitled 'Middleware and High Performance Analytics Libraries for Scalable Data Science' at a workshop in the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center on May 17, 2016. Additional information can be found in the <a href="papers.html">Papers</a> section under Indiana University.</p>
<p class="whitetext">The first workshop in the series STREAM2015 was held in Indianapolis on October 27th and 28th, 2015. Its focus was on application features and requirements as well as hardware and software systems needed to support them. More details are available <a href="http://streamingsystems.org/">here</a>.
 <br />
Members of the community are invited to submit a 1-2 page White Paper/Statement of Interest in areas of relevance to the workshop's scope and objectives. White papers are due by September 21 and should be sent to workshop organizers. Participants will be selected based upon relevance of submissions as well as strategic balance of expertise. Partial travel support is available

<p class="whitetext">Indiana University is pleased to host a new <a href="http://ipcc.soic.iu.edu">Intel Parallel Computing Center</a> as part of their longstanding tradition blending industry and academia. Prof. Judy Qiu heads this new center which also includes Prof. Steven Gottlieb of the IU Physics Dept. In addition a  $320,000 award from Intel will be used in funding research contributing to the SPIDAL project.</p>
<p class="whitetext">A hands-on workshop on the topic of CINET, a web-based network analysis tool, was hosted by the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech on July 10 and August 11, 2015. More information <a href="CINETWorkshop.pdf">here</a>.
<br />
In addition, Prof. Judy Qiu hosted a seminar on data analytics enhancement while attending the CINET workshop on July 9. Information on this seminar is found below:

<p class="whitetext">Kansas is preparing a 3-D imaging test setup for Dr. Crandall at Indiana University. This test setup is being designed to help ease integration of Dr. Crandall's global optimizer work into our 3-D imaging routines. We are also doing background reading on hidden Markov models and network flow algorithms for global optimization so that we can better support the integration.

<p class="whitetext">In March 2015, co-PI Prof. Judy Qiu received an Outstanding Junior Faculty award from Indiana University, as related in this IU <a href="http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2015/03/outstanding-junior-faculty.shtml">newsletter</a>.</p>
<p class="whitetext">An October 2014 <a href="http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/10/big-data-dibbs-grant.shtml">article</a> from Indiana University addresses the SPIDAL project and IU faculty who will be working on it.</p>
<p class="whitetext">Details are given on the DIBBs program, which includes our SPIDAL project, in an NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132880">announcement</a> from Oct. 2014.</p>
